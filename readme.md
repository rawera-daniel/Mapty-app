## Description:

Mapty is an exercise-tracking application designed to log two activities: running and cycling. It records running workouts, including details like distance, time, pace, steps per minute, and cycling workouts with details like distance, time, speed, and elevation gain. The app retrieves location coordinates for both activities from the map. The map displays all logged workouts, allowing users to easily identify their most frequented workout locations.
